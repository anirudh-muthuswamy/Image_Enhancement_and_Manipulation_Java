** Interacting with the Graphical User Interface ** 

The Graphical User Interface has been designed for the average joe. Hence performing operations on an image should be rather intuitive to the User. 

The Menu Bar on the top of the Application has 4 Options to choose form ie.(File, Filter,Transform,Modify).
1.The File Menu Item has 2 further submenu options : Load and Save. 
Both of these operations prompt another dialog box which opens the working directory of the user. The user can then choose which image to Load or Save. 


	 

2. The Filter Menu Item has SubMenu items to Blur, Sharpen and Dither the image present on the screen. 

3. The Transform Menu Item has a SubMenu Item to Grayscale, Brighten and Sepia an image. The Greyscale submenu also has options to choose the type of grayscale operatin to be performed.

4. The Modify Menu Item has Submenu Options to Flip an image, Horizontally and Vertically, as well as Split and Combine the image.

2. save image-path image-name: Save the image with the given name to the specified path.

3. greyscale <red,green,blue,luma,intensity,value>-component image-name dest-image-name: Create a greyscale image with the requested component of the image with the given name and refer to it henceforth by dest-immage-name. 

4. horizontal-flip image-name dest-image-name: Flip an image horizontally to create a new image, refer to it as dest-image-name.

5. vertical-flip image-name dest-image-name: Flip an image vertically to create a new image, refer to it as dest-image-name.

6. brighten increment image-name dest-image-name: brighten the image by the given increment to create a new image, referred to henceforth by dest-image-name.

7. rgb-split image-name dest-image-name-red dest-image-name-green dest-image-name-blue: split the given image into three greyscale images containing its red, green and blue components respectively.

8. rgb-combine image-name red-image green-image blue-image: Combine the three greyscale images into a single image that gets its red, green and blue components from the three images respectively.
